# Store Commerce app triggers and printing

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to use triggers to capture events that occur before and after any Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Store Commerce app operations.

You can use triggers to capture events that occur before or after Store Commerce app operations. Using triggers supports several business logic scenarios that enable you to do the following: 
- Insert custom logic before the operation runs or after it has completed. This includes operation-specific triggers and generic triggers called the PreOperationTrigger and PostOperationTrigger, which run at the beginning and end of all POS operations.  
- Continue or cancel an operation. For example, if your validation fails or returns an error, then you can cancel the operation in pre-trigger. Post-triggers are not cancelable.
- Use the post-trigger for scenarios where you want to show custom messages or insert custom fields after the standard logic is performed. 


The following table lists the available triggers and denotes whether they can be canceled.

## Business scenario

In this example, a custom receipt is printed when the user suspends a transaction. This example implements the **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger** trigger and prints the custom receipt using the existing print peripheral API.

To implement this scenario, you must complete these steps.

1. **POS extension:** Implement the **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger** trigger to get the receipt data from CRT and send it to the printer for printing. 
2. **CRT extension:** Generate the receipt data for printing.

## Implement a trigger

To implement a trigger, follow these steps.

1. Open Visual Studio 2015 in administrator mode.
2. Open the **ModernPOS** solution from **…\RetailSDK\POS**.
3. Under the **POS.Extensions** project, create a new folder named **SuspendReceiptSample**.
4. Under **SuspendReceiptSample**, create new folder named **TriggersHandlers**.
5. In the **TriggersHandlers** folder, add a new Typescript file named **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger.ts**.
6. Add the following **import** statements to import the relevant entities and context.

   ```typescript
   import * as Triggers from "PosApi/Extend/Triggers/TransactionTriggers";
   import { ObjectExtensions } from "PosApi/TypeExtensions";
   import { ClientEntities, ProxyEntities } from "PosApi/Entities";
   import { PrinterPrintRequest, PrinterPrintResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Peripherals";
   import { GetHardwareProfileClientRequest, GetHardwareProfileClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Device";
   import { GetReceiptsClientRequest, GetReceiptsClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/SalesOrders";
   ```
   
7. Create a new class named **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger** and extend it from **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger**.
 
	```typescript
    export default class PostSuspendTransactionTrigger extends Triggers.PostSuspendTransactionTrigger { }
	```
8. Implement the trigger's **execute** method to get the receipt profile and print the custom receipt:
   
    ```typescript
    public execute(options: Triggers.IPostSuspendTransactionTriggerOptions): Promise < void> {
        this.context.logger.logVerbose("Executing PostSuspendTransactionTrigger with options " + JSON.stringify(options) + ".");
        if(ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options) || ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options.cart)) {
           
           // This will never happen, but is included to demonstrate how to return a rejected promise when validation fails.
           
           let error: ClientEntities.ExtensionError
                = new ClientEntities.ExtensionError("The options provided to the PostSuspendTransactionTrigger were invalid.");
            return Promise.reject(error);
        } else {
            return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(new GetHardwareProfileClientRequest())
                .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetHardwareProfileClientResponse>)
                    : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>> => {
                    let hardwareProfile: ProxyEntities.HardwareProfile = response.data.result;
                    // Gets the receipts.
                    let salesOrderId: string = options.cart.Id;
                    let receiptRetrievalCriteria: ProxyEntities.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria = {
                        IsCopy: false,
                        IsRemoteTransaction: false,
                        IsPreview: false,
                        QueryBySalesId: true,
                        ReceiptTypeValue: ProxyEntities.ReceiptType.CustomReceipt7,
                        HardwareProfileId: hardwareProfile.ProfileId
                    };
                    let getReceiptsClientRequest: GetReceiptsClientRequest<GetReceiptsClientResponse> =
                        new GetReceiptsClientRequest(salesOrderId, receiptRetrievalCriteria);
                    return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(getReceiptsClientRequest);
                })
                .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>)
                    : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<PrinterPrintResponse>> => {
                    let receipts: ProxyEntities.Receipt[] = response.data.result;
                    // Prints the receipts.
                    let printerPrintRequest: PrinterPrintRequest<PrinterPrintResponse> = new PrinterPrintRequest(receipts);
                    return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(printerPrintRequest);
                }).then((): Promise<void> => {
                    // Resolves to a void result when fulfilled.
                    return Promise.resolve();
                }).catch((reason: any): Promise<void> => {
                    // Resolves to a void result when rejected. This matches existing POS printing behavior.
                    this.context.logger.logError("PostSuspendTransactionTrigger execute error: " + JSON.stringify(reason));
                    return Promise.resolve();
                });
        }
    }
   ```
   
   The entire example should look like the following.

	```typescript
    import * as Triggers from "PosApi/Extend/Triggers/TransactionTriggers";

            if (ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options) || ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options.cart)) {
                // This will never happen, but is included to demonstrate how to return a rejected promise when validation fails.

                return Promise.reject(error);
            } else {
                return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(new GetHardwareProfileClientRequest())
                    .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetHardwareProfileClientResponse>)

                        let receiptRetrievalCriteria: ProxyEntities.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria = {
                            IsCopy: false,
                            IsRemoteTransaction: false,
                            IsPreview: false,
                            QueryBySalesId: true,
                            ReceiptTypeValue: ProxyEntities.ReceiptType.CustomReceipt7,
                            HardwareProfileId: hardwareProfile.ProfileId
                        };
                        let getReceiptsClientRequest: GetReceiptsClientRequest<GetReceiptsClientResponse> =

                    })
                    .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>)
                        : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<PrinterPrintResponse>> => {

                        // Prints the receipts.
                        let printerPrintRequest: PrinterPrintRequest<PrinterPrintResponse> = new PrinterPrintRequest(receipts);
                        return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(printerPrintRequest);

                    });
            }
        }
    }
	```
9. Create a new .json file under the **SuspendReceiptSample** folder and name it **manifest.json**.
10. Replace the autogenerated code in **manifest.json** with the following code.

	```typescript
    {
        "$schema": "../manifestSchema.json",
            "name": "Pos_Extensibility_SuspendTransactionReceiptSample",
                "publisher": "Microsoft",
                    "version": "7.2.0",
                        "minimumPosVersion": "7.2.0.0",
                            "components": {
            "extend": {
                "triggers": [
                    {
                        "triggerType": "PostSuspendTransaction",
                        "modulePath": "TriggersHandlers/PostSuspendTransactionTrigger"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
	```
11. Open the **extensions.json** file in the **POS.Extensions** project and update it with the **SuspendReceiptSample** samples, so that during runtime POS will include this extension.

	```typescript
    {
        "extensionPackages": [
            {
                "baseUrl": "SampleExtensions2"
            },
            {
                "baseUrl": "SuspendReceiptSample"
            }
        ]
    }
	```
12. Open the **tsconfig.json** file and comment out the extension package folders from the exclude list. POS will use this file to include or exclude the extension. By default, the list contains all the excluded extensions list. If you want to include an extension that is part of the POS, then add the extension folder name and comment out the extension from the extension, as shown.

	```typescript
    "exclude": [
        "AuditEventExtensionSample",
        "B2BSample",
        "CustomerSearchWithAttributesSample",
        "FiscalRegisterSample",
        "PaymentSample",
        "PromotionsSample",
        "SalesTransactionSignatureSample",
        "SampleExtensions",
        //"SampleExtensions2",
        "StoreHoursSample",
        "SuspendTransactionReceiptSample"
        //"POSAPIExtension",
        //"CustomColumnExtensions",
        //"EODSample",
        //"ProdDetailsCustomColumnExtensions",
        //"SerachExtension",
        //"SuspendReceiptSample"
    ],
	```
13. Compile and rebuild the project.

## Override the CRT receipt request to generate the receipt data

The following procedure describes how to override an existing CRT request to print a receipt for suspended transactions. 

To override the CRT receipt request to generate the receipt data, follow these steps.

1. Start Visual Studio 2015.
2. On the **File** menu, select **Open \> Project/Solution**. Find the template project (**SampleCRTExtension.csproj**).
3. Rename the template project **Runtime.Extensions.SuspendReceiptSample**.
4. Optional: Change the default namespace.
5. Rename the output assembly **Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.SuspendReceiptSample**.
6. Inside the project, add a new request class file, and name it **GetCustomReceiptsRequestHandler.cs**.
7. Copy the following code, and paste it inside the class. Before you copy it, delete the automatically generated code.

    ```C#
    namespace Contoso
    {
        namespace Commerce.Runtime.ReceiptsSample
        {
            using System.Collections.Generic;
            using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime;
            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataModel;
            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Messages;
            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Services.Messages;
            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Workflow;

            /// <summary>
            /// The request handler for GetCustomReceiptsRequestHandler class.
            /// </summary>

            /// <remarks>
            /// This is an example of how to print custom types of receipts. In this example the receipt is for a transaction as opposed to
            /// a sales order. The implementation converts the transaction to a sales order so that existing receipt fields can be used.
            /// </remarks>

            public class GetCustomReceiptsRequestHandler : SingleRequestHandler<GetCustomReceiptsRequest, GetReceiptResponse>
            {
            }
        }
    }
    ```

8. Copy the following code, and paste it inside the class to add a new method to read the transaction from the cart table, because suspended transactions aren't yet created in the commerce transaction table. You must then convert the cart transaction to sales transaction. This conversion is required because the receipt object can understand only sales transactions.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're printing a custom receipt for a completed transaction, you have don't have to get the cart transaction and convert it to a sales transaction. It has already been converted to a sales transaction, because the transaction is completed.

    ```C#
    private SalesOrder GetSalesOrderForTransactionWithId(RequestContext requestContext, string transactionId)
    {
        SalesOrder salesOrder = new SalesOrder();
        var getCartRequest = new GetCartRequest(new CartSearchCriteria(transactionId), QueryResultSettings.SingleRecord);
        var getCartResponse = requestContext.Execute<GetCartResponse>(getCartRequest);
        SalesTransaction salesTransaction = getCartResponse.Transactions.SingleOrDefault(); ;
        if (salesTransaction != null)
        {
            // The sales transaction is converted into a sales order so that existing receipt fields can be used.
            salesOrder.CopyFrom<SalesTransaction>(salesTransaction);
        }
        else
        {
            throw new DataValidationException(
                DataValidationErrors.Microsoft_Dynamics_Commerce_Runtime_ObjectNotFound,
                string.Format("Unable to get the sales transaction. ID: {0}", transactionId));
        }
        return salesOrder;
    }
    ```

9. Copy the following code, and paste it into the class to add a new method to construct the receipt format by using the sales transaction information, based on the custom receipt format that is defined in HQ.

    ```C#
    private Collection<Receipt> GetCustomReceipts(SalesOrder salesOrder, ReceiptRetrievalCriteria criteria)
    {
        Collection<Receipt> result = new Collection<Receipt>();
        var getReceiptServiceRequest = new GetReceiptServiceRequest(
            salesOrder,
            new Collection<ReceiptType> { criteria.ReceiptType },
            salesOrder.TenderLines,
            criteria.IsCopy,
            criteria.IsPreview,
            criteria.HardwareProfileId);
        ReadOnlyCollection<Receipt> customReceipts = this.Context.Execute<GetReceiptServiceResponse>(getReceiptServiceRequest).Receipts;
        result.AddRange(customReceipts);
        return result;
    }
    ```

10. Copy the following code, and paste it into the class to add a new method to override the get receipt response. This method processes the request and returns the response.

    ```C#
    protected override GetReceiptResponse Process(GetCustomReceiptsRequest request)
    {
        ThrowIf.Null(request, "request");
        ThrowIf.Null(request.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria, "request.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria");

        // The sales order that we are printing receipts for is retrieved.
        SalesOrder salesOrder = this.GetSalesOrderForTransactionWithId(request.RequestContext, request.TransactionId);

        // Custom receipts are printed.
        Collection<Receipt> result = new Collection<Receipt>();
        switch (request.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria.ReceiptType)
        {
            // An example of getting custom receipts.
            case ReceiptType.CustomReceipt7:
            {
                IEnumerable<Receipt> customReceipts = this.GetCustomReceipts(salesOrder, request.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria);
                result.AddRange(customReceipts);
            }
            break;
            default:

            // Add more logic to handle more types of custom receipt types.

            break;
        }
        return new GetReceiptResponse(new ReadOnlyCollection<Receipt>(result));
    }
    ```

    The overall code should look like this.

    ```C#
    namespace Contoso
    {
        namespace Commerce.Runtime.ReceiptsSample
        {
            using System.Collections.Generic;
            using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime;
            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataModel;
            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Messages;

                {

                    ThrowIf.Null(request.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria, "request.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria");

                    // The sales order that we are printing receipts for is retrieved.

11. Compile and build the project.
12. Go to the output directory, and copy the output assembly.
13. Navigate to the **…\\RetailServer\\webroot\\bin\\ext** folder, and paste the assembly.
14. Also paste the assembly in the **…\\RetailSDK\\References** folder.
15. Open the **commerceruntime.ext.config** file, and add the custom assembly information under the \<composition\> section.

    ```xml
    <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.SuspendReceiptSample" />
    ```

16. Save and close the file.
